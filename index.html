    <h1>The Benefits of Computer Science</h1>
    <p>
      Here is where I will begin to talk about the benefits of Computer Science, specifically today I will discuss the advancements in communication
      Improvement to communication has been one of humanities' biggest focus when it comes to the advancements of technology (other than finding better ways to kill people)
      This is due to communication being at the forefront of everybodies daily lives

      Some of the benefits of communication include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to work on projects together</li>
      <li>The ability to express feelings over long distances</li>
      <li>Talking to people from other countries </li>
    </ul>

    <p> In the past few thousand years we have went from writing on stone tablets, to writing letters that cross seas, to being able to send a message instantly to anybody in the world, at any time!</p>
